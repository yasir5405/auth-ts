üîê 3. Security & Auth

Goal: Deeply understand auth flows and secure APIs.
Ideas:

Advanced Auth Server

Implement OAuth2 + refresh tokens manually.

Support Google login, session revocation, and multi-factor auth (OTP/email).

Audit Logging System

Every API call logs user, IP, time, and action.

Store immutable logs, expose a search API with role-based access.
