📧 3. Account Verification & Anti-Abuse

Optional CAPTCHA (reCAPTCHA) to stop bot registrations.

🔐 6. Post-Signup Enhancements

Automatic login or token generation after signup (JWT/session).

Welcome email after successful registration.

Audit/log user creation events for monitoring.

🧰 7. Developer Experience

Use a consistent error handler middleware to avoid repeating try/catch.

Implement async error wrapping with a helper like:

const asyncHandler = (fn) => (req, res, next) => Promise.resolve(fn(req, res, next)).catch(next);

Add unit/integration tests for all signup edge cases.
